### Project description: 
This simple project consists of a screen-independent canvas (960x600), 
a button (Move Ball), a text (title with developer name), a script (moving the ball with the button), 
and a GameObjects ball (standart sprite, "knob" from Unity)

When pressing the button "Move Ball" the ball moves randomly to a new position. 
4 Positions are available (4 empty GameObjects: PosBottomLeft, PosBottomRight, PosTopLeft, PosTopRight).
There are 2 different variations for moving the ball to the positions randomly.
* Variation 1: direct repetition of the randomly chosen position is possible.
* Variation 2: the randomly chosen position is forced to be different, i.e. new position != old position  

### Development platform: 
* Windows 10 64 bit; 
* Unity Version: 2019.1.14f1; 
* Visual Studio Version: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019, Version 16.4.2;
* Scripting Runtime Version: 4.X;
